# Deep Learning with NumPy
This is a deep learning project implemented in NumPy, designed as part of my "**Machine learning systems**" univeristy classes. The project is aimed at developing my understanding and implementation skills in deep learning concepts and techniques, and as for now is still in progress.

## Overview
The project is focused on building a deep neural network from scratch, without the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and principles of deep learning, and to develop a more granular understanding of how each individual component of a neural network contributes to its overall performance.

## Contents
This implementation aims to cover the following aspects of deep learning:
- Neural network architecture: designing and implementing the basic building blocks of a neural network, including fully connected layers, activation functions, and loss functions.
- Backpropagation algorithm: implementing the backpropagation algorithm to train the neural network, including techniques such as gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent.
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs): extending the basic neural network architecture to support convolutional layers and pooling layers
- Recurrent neural networks (RNNs):implementing popular RNN architectures such as LSTM and GRU.
- Model training and testing: building the neural network, training the model and results evaluation
